Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is ClÃ©ment and I live in the beautiful city of [Nancy](https://www.google.com/search?q=nancy,+france), France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

I started my career with a Ph.D thesis on [Verification of object-oriented programs with linear logic](https://theses.hal.science/tel-00424979/). Then I was on the engineering team when [Prove & Run](https://provenrun.com/) started. At Prove & Run, I co-authored a compiler and prover for a C-like functional programming language (yes! Think C without pointer and where `=` is deep copy ðŸ¤¯). This was the time I discovered that I am a software engineering leader: I inspire people and create teams and processes that deliver.

I love explaining technical content to my fellows. For example, I'm still pretty proud of this paper on [parallelizing programs by rewriting their linear proofs](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00380528/). At [Tweag](https://www.tweag.io/) my job allowed me to talk publicly about my professional interests, for example I wrote about:

1. [Building Haskell programs with Bazel](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-06-convert-haskell-project-to-bazel/)
1. [Monads in OCaml](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-02-25-tezos-ocaml-monad/)
1. [Python Monorepos](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2023-04-04-python-monorepo-1/). This one is #1 for [Google's search](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+monorepo) for "python monorepo" ðŸ‘‘

I pitch the technologies I love, for example with [this case study](https://moduscreate.com/case-study/kaiko/) of my work for a healthcare scale-up or when I presented at Modus Create's [Developer Productivity Days](https://moduscreate.com/developer-productivity-summit-resources/). I love contributing to the company's strategy, understanding its constraints and trajectory, to drive the product and energize the teams accordingly.

At [Modus Create](https://moduscreate.com/) (the company that acquired Tweag), I am the Director of the Build Systems Department. My responsibilities include hiring, consultants allocation, career path development, salary reviews, and sales activities. I oversee the growth of the software engineers in my department (20 people) and I support the tech leads on client projects. I foster collaboration between our clients and our partners, by recommending the right tools to clients who will benefit from them the most.
